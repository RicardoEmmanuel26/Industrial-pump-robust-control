## Key Results
- Both PI and PID controllers achieve stable closed-loop performance under nominal conditions
- PI control was selected due to comparable performance and lower complexity
- The system maintains stability under parameter uncertainty and external disturbances
- Extended overload tests show increased overshoot but successful recovery without instability
